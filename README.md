# pdf_split
A small python program to split a PDF, into smaller ones. Intended to split a PDF by pages ranges.

Most of the magic happens in pdf_split and the rest of the program is meant to  help the user create the dictionary of output file strings and page number lists to feed to pdf_split.

The intention is to also allow the user to specify a list of filenames from sources such as a database, Excel file or CSV to personalise the output PDF names.
